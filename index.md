## About Me

![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Abha_portrait.jpeg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Abha Bhole and I am a 3rd Year Mechanical Engineering undergraduate student at Cornell University.

My interests lie in Mechanical and Engineering Design, Fluid Mechanics, and Technology for Sustainibility. I have explored all of these topics in my university coursework, and in independent projects, using CAD tools, MATLAB, and interactive physical experience with systems to create a foundation of knowledge.

I am most passionate about everyday applications of complex systems, such as sustainable equivalents to AC, and the intersection of fluid mechanics in modern daily life. I also have an interest in interdiscplinary aspects of engineering design, and user-system interactions.

This portfolio showcases a combination of coursework projects and independant projects relevant to my growth as an engineer.
